CodeCracker: Assembly Edition is an interactive, educational game built with React that challenges players to uncover hidden code snippets in a hangman-style format. As you guess letters, portions of a real-world code example are progressively revealed. Successfully guessing the word unlocks the complete, syntax-highlighted snippet along with an in-depth explanation of its functionality. This project not only reinforces programming fundamentals but also offers a fun, engaging way to learn and explore various coding concepts. Ideal for developers seeking to sharpen their skills while enjoying a unique coding challenge!
